Welcome to my Arduino Projects repository! This collection includes a variety of hands-on projects that explore the fascinating intersection of **programming, electronics, and robotics**. The content here is a mix of **academic work** developed during my studies at **U-Tad University** and **personal experiments** aimed at deepening my understanding of embedded systems.

Whether you're just starting with Arduino or looking to expand your knowledge, this repository offers a **structured learning path** to guide you through the essentials and beyond.

## What is Arduino?

**Arduino** is an open-source electronics platform based on simple, user-friendly hardware and software. It's designed for anyoneâ€”beginners and professionals alikeâ€”to build interactive electronic projects. With Arduino, you can connect sensors, actuators, displays, and more to a microcontroller, bringing your ideas to lifeâ€”from a blinking LED to a fully functioning robot.
